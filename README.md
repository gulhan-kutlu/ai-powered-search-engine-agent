## My Contributions
AI-Driven Intelligent Agent for Search Engine Optimization  
This project focuses on designing an AI-powered intelligent agent to enhance search efficiency,
ranking accuracy, and semantic relevance in search engines.


- Designed and implemented intelligent agent logic for personalized search
- Built classification and regression models to analyze user behavior patterns
- Performed data preprocessing, encoding, and exploratory analysis
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy, confusion matrices, and error metrics
- Analyzed limitations of datasets and model generalization

## Model Training & Evaluation

This stage focused on evaluating baseline model performance using logistic regression,
with accuracy and confusion matrix analysis to assess classification behavior and model limitations.

>  The observed accuracy highlights dataset imbalance and feature limitations, which were analyzed as part of model generalization assessment.

## System & Agent Architecture (Conceptual Background)

The following diagrams provide theoretical context for the intelligent agent
design used in this project. They illustrate how agent-based systems perceive
their environment, process information, and take actions.

 These visuals are included to explain the conceptual foundation behind the
AI-driven search agent rather than implementation details.

The diagrams above illustrate the conceptual model of intelligent agents and
personalized search systems.

In this project, these concepts were adapted to design an AI-driven search
agent capable of analyzing user behavior, processing semantic information,
and optimizing search relevance.

While the figures represent theoretical agent architectures, the actual
implementation focuses on data preprocessing, feature engineering, machine
learning model development, and performance evaluation.
